# Understanding NinjaView: Understanding How NinaView Works and Addressing Potential Antivirus Flags



## Introduction

This document serves as an informative guide, detailing the functionality and setup process of a Python script integral to the NinjaView application. It is worth mentioning that, although the application is secure, certain antivirus programs might mistakenly identify it as a potential threat. This document aims to address these concerns and guide users through the installation and execution process.

`nv.py` uses NinjaTrader's Advanced Trade Interface (ATI) to place trades and manage orders. It establishes a connection to NinjaTrader's ATI port and sends trading commands directly, ensuring a seamless and swift execution of trades. Below is a simplified example of how it sends a trade command to NinjaTrader:

```

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure that you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- **Python**: Version 3.6 or later
- **pip**: A package installer for Python

You can install the required Python packages using the following command:

```sh
pip install flask pystray Pillow requests psutil pyperclip

```
## Setting Up the Script
Download the Script: Clone the repository or download the script from the provided source.
Navigate to the Script's Directory: Use your command line tool to go to the script's folder.
```cd path/to/script/directory```

Install Virtual Environment (Optional): It is a good practice to create a virtual environment to isolate the project dependencies.

```
cd path/to/script/directory

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
source venv/bin/activate  # On Unix or MacOS
```
Install Requirements: Install the required packages using pip:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
or
pip install flask pystray Pillow requests psutil pyperclip
```
Note: Some of the packages that might be required include os, winreg, sys, uuid, time, logging, hashlib, signal, threading, psutil, PIL, tkinter, base64, atexit, subprocess, requests, pyperclip, pystray, flask, and ngrok.

Running the Script
Execute the Script: Run the script using Python.
```
python nv.py
```
Compiling with PyInstaller
Install PyInstaller: If you donâ€™t have PyInstaller installed, you can install it using pip:

```
pip install pyinstaller
```
Compile the Script: Use PyInstaller to compile the script.


```
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole nv.py
```
If you want to add an icon to the executable, you can use the --icon option (This will cause more false anti-virus flags:

```
pyinstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=icon.ico nv.py
```
Replace icon.ico with the path to your icon file.

## Note on False Positive Antivirus Flags
When compiling Python scripts to executable files using PyInstaller, the resulting executable might be flagged by some antivirus programs as suspicious or malicious. This is a known issue with PyInstaller and other similar tools, and it happens because:

Heuristic Analysis: Antivirus programs use heuristic analysis to detect unusual patterns that might indicate malicious behavior. Compiled Python scripts often exhibit such patterns because the Python interpreter, script, and all dependencies are bundled into a single executable file.

Code Obfuscation: Some parts of the Python script may be obfuscated to protect intellectual property, which can trigger false positives.

Lack of Reputation: Newly created or rarely downloaded files might not have an established reputation, making them more likely to be flagged as potential threats.

Use in Malware: Unfortunately, attackers sometimes use tools like PyInstaller to package malicious scripts, which has led to a negative reputation for executables created with these tools.
